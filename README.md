# About Me

Hello there! I am a full stack developer with extensive experience in a variety of technologies. I have a passion for writing clean, efficient code and always seek to learn more. I love tackling complex problems and turning them into simple, effective solutions.

# Skills and Technologies

I specialize in the following technologies:

- **React JS**: I have a deep understanding of React and its ecosystem. I can create responsive and performant user interfaces, and have experience in using Hooks, Redux, and other related libraries.

- **NodeJS**: I have used NodeJS to build robust and scalable backend services. I am proficient in ExpressJS and have a good understanding of the Event Loop, non-blocking I/O, and other essential aspects of Node.

- **TypeScript**: I use TypeScript to write safer, self-documenting JavaScript code. I am familiar with advanced concepts like type guards, conditional types, and mapped types.

- **AWS**: I have experience with various AWS services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and DynamoDB. I can architect and manage cloud infrastructure, and have a good understanding of IAM, VPC, and other security aspects.

I am always looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills. Feel free to reach out to me if you have a project that you think I could help with.
